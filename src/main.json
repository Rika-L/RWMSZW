Experts have found that some coins have the inscription 'Mahogany Khan' on the back, and it is likely that they were minted during the time of Suleyman bin Yusuf, who ascended the throne of the Great Khan in 1032. There have been many explanations about the meaning of 'peach blossom stone'. In the 1980s, historian Zhang Xun proposed that 'peach blossom stone' means 'Great Khan' in Chinese. Later scholars proposed on this basis, 'peach blossom stone' means 'big Han'. Tian Weijiang, a researcher at the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences, believes that 'although each has its own meaning, they all refer to China.' The so-called 'peach blossom stone' in the Qarakhan Dynasty also implies the meaning of 'great and ancient', which should be derived from the name of 'powerful China in the East'. Therefore, 'Mahogany Khan' is also often used as a title for khans, meaning 'Khan of an ancient and powerful country.' 'Peach Blossom Stone', this beautiful name, deeply explains the historical understanding of the Western regions to the Central Plains, reflecting the close connection between the Western regions and the Central Plains."
